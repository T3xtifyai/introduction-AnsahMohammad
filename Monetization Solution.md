# Various AI Monetization Solutions

## 1. Premium - Version
Giving the public access to only the few features while premium users can get full features. for example, let's think of GPT. We can make a plus subscription for users to use images and more than 500+ char long prompts. So the users will be tempted to buy the full version after using the minimal basic version.

## 2. Subscription Based
We can create a subscription based website, where once paid, all the AI tools will be made available for free. This model can be successful when you have large variety of models within the organizations.

## 3. Advertisements
We can post advertisements while the AI is generating the response, so the user has no choice but to watch the add. And a premium version can also be added to skip the ads.

## 4. Payment based
This kind of monetization is when we provide API and the developer of the organization has to pay for the API calls. This gives the developer the flexibility to choose the plan based on his/her application making the Model widely acceptable.
